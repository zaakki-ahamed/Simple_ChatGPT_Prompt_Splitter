# Simple_ChatGPT_Prompt_Splitter
A simple prompt splitter to break down large prompts into chunks. No frills, no complications.

## Introduction
ChatGPT only supports a maximum of 2048 characters. This is a problem when it comes to large prompts and an error will prevent it from processing your request

## Existing solutions
There are many prompt splitters available. But most of them require the installation and configuration of many packages. It makes it needlessly complicated.

## What this script offers
A simple, no frills solution to generating prompts which you can simply copy and paste into ChatGPT.

## How to use
1. Copy the python script file "split_for_prompy.py" into the same folder as the input file (large prompt) you want to break down.
2. The input file should be in plain text (.txt). Rename it to "Input_to_ChatGPT.txt".
3. Run the python program.
4. Output will be named "generated_promps.txt" in the same folder as the script.

That's it! Now simpy copy and paste the chunks which will be broken down and numbered.
